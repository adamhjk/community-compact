# The Community Compact 0.1

## Preamble

This document describes the social contract which defines the community around
the "[SOFTWARE]" piece of open source software ("the software"). It lays out
the moral and ethical rules the community agrees to in order to ensure a long,
healthy, sustainable life for the software.

It is not a legal agreement, although sections of it reference legal
agreements. It is a moral and ethical one - it is the foundation upon which the
community is built. 

By joining the community, you agree to the rules and beliefs outlined in this
compact.


## Core beliefs

We believe that the right to share, study, and modify [SOFTWARE] is at the
foundation of our community. This right extends to every person who interacts
with [SOFTWARE] - those who write the code, those who help solve problems,
those who evangelize its use, and those who use the software. It is this
right that creates the basis for a functioning community, one where we all
have equal opportunity to participate and evolve the software.

We also believe that, in order to have the most impact, our software and 
community must be economically and ethically sustainable. We have a firm 
commitment to building that sustainability in harmony with the rights to 
share, study, and modify the software.

### Who We Are

We believe that the community encompases every person and organization who has 
a relationship with the software, regardless of the nature of that relationship.
We make no distinction between those who write the software, who ship the
software, who build businesses on the software, or who participate in the many
activities required to sustain the community. We are a single, holistic community
bound together by the common desire to see the software grow and improve.

### Building a Sustainable Business

We believe that the software we produce has value, and as that value is used to
create wealth, a portion of that wealth should be used to foster and sustain
the community. To that end, the original authors, [AUTHORS], have created a
business ([BUSINESS]), which will sell goods and services related to the
software. In return for this privilege, [BUSINESS] commits that all software it
creates will be made available to the community under an open source license.

Should [BUSINESS] cease to be an acceptable member of the community, we believe 
that the community has the right to take the software, form a new community, and 
create a new sustainability model. They can do so safe in the knowledge that it 
is not seen as an act of hostility - instead, it is the ultimate expression of 
our belief that everyone has the right to share, study, and modify the software.

## Details

### Code of Conduct

This community follows the [CODE OF CONDUCT LINK].  Violations should be
reported to [COC EMAIL ADDRESS]. 

### Software License

The software covered by this Community Compact is licensed under the [OSI
APPROVED LICENSE]. 

### Copyright License

Each contributor to the software retains ownership over their contribution,
but licenses it under the same terms as the original authors. This creates an
environment where all contributors share ownership, and ensures that no single
entity can unilaterally change the licensing terms.

This is a foundational moral and ethical right of the community - we have all
voluntarily joined together in the creation of [SOFTWARE], and therefore no
single entity can own the [SOFTWARE].

### The Business

This software was originally created by [AUTHORS]. It was their original intent
to create a vibrant, sustainable, diverse open source community. To that end,
they intend to have a business, [BUSINESS], which sells goods and services
related to the software, in order to further sustain and grow the community and
the software.

[BUSINESS] will sell a distribution of [SOFTWARE] with commercial terms,
enforced by its trademark on [SOFTWARE]. It will also, at its option, provide a
Network Service (SaaS) and/or provide Consulting and Support. Competitive
Network Services or Consulting offerings require a special license from the
[BUSINESS]. 

In return for the right to monetize the [SOFTWARE] on behalf of the community,
[BUSINESS] commits that all the software it publishes will be published under
the terms outlined in this compact. 

### Trademarks

[BUSINESS] retains the rights to the [SOFTWARE] trademark, and has the full
ability to decide how that trademark may be applied. The [LINK TO THE TRADEMARK
POLICY] can always be found here.

As a policy, [BUSINESS] does not license the Trademark for use by any other
organization for any commercial purposes, except through specific license
agreements with [BUSINESS].

### Patents

Any Patents that pertain to [SOFTWARE] exist to be used defensively, to
protect the [SOFTWARE] and the [COMMUNITY] in the event of patent litigation.

### Distribution License

[BUSINESS] will create and maintain the community's official distributions of
the [SOFTWARE].  As part of the creation of a business to sustain the
community, [BUSINESS] will have separate licensing terms for use of this 
distribution of the [SOFTWARE].

This is to ensure [BUSINESS] has a viable option for monetization of the
[SOFTWARE]. Combined with [BUSINESS] control of the [SOFTWARE] trademark, it
ensures that [BUSINESS] remains in control of how the Community's official build
of the software is distributed. 

### Network Services License

[BUSINESS] may create network services around or in support of the software,
subject to various Terms of Service. [BUSINESS] may use these Terms of Service
to further monetize the [SOFTWARE].

If other parties wish to run network services around the [SOFTWARE], we ask
that they contribute to the community through the purchase of a network
services subscription from [BUSINESS], in order to use the communities
trademark and official builds.

### Consulting License

As the community grows, the desire for consulting businesses may also grow. The
community's desire is that, if you intend to make money on the [SOFTWARE] through
consulting and support, you contribute to the community through purchasing a
consulting license subscription from [BUSINESS], certifying that you are an
organization who supports the community. This enables you to use the communities
trademarks and official builds.

We ask that all members of the community utilizing consulting businesses do so
from only those organizations committed to the community's growth and health.

### Contribution

The community accepts contributions according to the [MAINTENANCE POLICY]. A
list of named Maintainers will be kept with the source code. Maintainers
may be called upon to vote from time to time, according to the [VOTING POLICY].

The [SOFTWARE] belongs to the community, and as such, the Maintainers have the
final say on the source code.

### Contributor Exception

Contributors to the software or community may request an exception to the
FREELOADERS clause. It will be granted by by a 3/4 vote of the Maintainers.

Contributors to the software or community may request a reduced price ($1 USD, or
equivalent) Network Services Subscription or Consulting License from the
Maintainers. It will be granted by the [BUSINESS] on a 3/4 vote by the
Maintainers. 

### Right to Fork

At any time, any member of the community is allowed to exercise their right
to take the [SOFTWARE] and create a new community, subject to the software
license, copyright license, and trademark policy of this community.

If [BUSINESS] decides to restrict the use of [SOFTWARE] in a way that members
of the community disagree with, they have the right to exercise their freedoms
under the software license, and create a new distribution of the software
without any mention of [SOFTWARE] trademark or branding. This is not a hostile
act - it is this communities desire that such new communities form, if an
agreement cannot be reached. Such communities require a new name, and a new,
independent support model.

[BUSINESS] will provide a mechanism whereby a build of the [SOFTWARE]
can be created with a user-supplied name in place of the [SOFTWARE]'s
trademarks. These builds will only have the terms of the Software License
applied to them. This ensures that the barriers to forking are not artifically
high - it is a mechanism available to every member of the community, and a
foundational right of the community upheld by the [BUSINESS].
