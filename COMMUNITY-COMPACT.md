# The Community Compact 0.1

## Preamble

This document describes the social contract which defines the community around
the "[SOFTWARE]" piece of open source software. It lays out the moral and
political rules the community agrees to in order to ensure a long, healthy,
sustainable life for that software.

It is not a legal agreement, although sections of it likely reference legal
agreements. It is a moral and ethical one - it is the foundation upon which all 
communities appear. 

By joining the community, you agree to the rules outlined in this compact.

## Code of Conduct

This community follows the [CODE OF CONDUCT LINK].
Violations should be reported to [COC EMAIL ADDRESS]. 

## Original Intent

This software was originally created by [AUTHORS]. It was
their original intent to create a vibrant, sustainable, diverse open source
community. To that end, they intend to have a business, [BUSINESS],
which sells goods and services related to the software, in order to
further sustain and grow the community and the software.

[BUSINESS] will sell a distribution of [SOFTWARE] with commercial terms,
enforced by its trademark on [SOFTWARE]. It will also, at its option,
provide a Network Service (SaaS) or Consulting and Support. Competitive
Network Services or Consulting offerings require a special license. An 
exception is granted to significant contributors to the software, as
an alternate means of community support.

## Right to Fork

At any time, any member of the Community is allowed to exercise their right
to take the [SOFTWARE] and create a new community, subject to the software
license, copyright license, and trademark policy of this community.

If [BUSINESS] decides to restrict the use of [SOFTWARE] in a way that members
of the community disagree with, they have the right to exercise their freedoms
under the software license, and create a new distribution of the software
without any mention of [SOFTWARE] trademark or branding.

This is not a hostile act - it is a recognition of the symbiotic relationship
between the [BUSINESS] and the Community. Ultimately, both exist to serve the
[SOFTWARE], and if that cannot be reconciled, it is our desire collective
desire that new communities form. Such communities require a new name,
and a new, independent support model.

[BUSINESS] must remain a good, true, and honest steward of the Community,
or lose all the privileges outlined in this compact.

## Software License

The software covered by this Community Compact is licensed under the [OSI
APPROVED LICENSE]. 

## Copyright License

Each contributor to the software retains ownership over their contribution,
but licenses it under the same terms as the original authors. This creates an
environment where all contributors share ownership, and ensures that no single
entity, including [BUSINESS], can unilaterally change the licensing terms.

This is a foundational moral and ethical right of the community - we have all
voluntarily joined together in the creation of [SOFTWARE], and therefore no
single entity can own the [SOFTWARE].

## Contribution

The community accepts contributions according to the [MAINTENANCE POLICY]. A
list of named Maintainers] will be kept with the source code. Maintainers
may be called upon to vote from time to time, according to the [VOTING POLICY].

The [SOFTWARE] belongs to the community, and as such, the Maintainers have the
final say on the source code.

## Trademarks

[BUSINESS] retains the rights to the [SOFTWARE] trademark, and has the full
ability to decide how that trademark may be applied. The [LINK TO THE TRADEMARK
POLICY] can always be found here.

As a policy, [BUSINESS] does not license the Trademark for use by any other
organization for any commercial purposes, except through specific license
agreements with [BUSINESS].

## Patents

Any Patents that pertain to [SOFTWARE] exist to be used defensively, to
protect the [SOFTWARE] and the [COMMUNITY] in the event of patent litigation.

## Distribution License

[BUSINESS] will create and maintain the community's official distributions of
the [SOFTWARE].  As part of the creation of a business to sustain the
community, [BUSINESS] will have separate licensing terms for use of its
distribution of the [SOFTWARE].

This is to ensure [BUSINESS] has a viable option for monetization of the
[SOFTWARE]. Combined with [BUSINESS] control of the [SOFTWARE] trademark, it
ensures that [BUSINESS] remains in control of how the Community's official build
of the software is distributed. 

In addition, the [BUSINESS] will produce a separate, identical, "non-community"
(or "nc") build. This build will have no legal restrictions on it's use. It
will, however, have a moral and ethical restriction: use of this build of the
software for commercial purposes is seen as a direct violation of the community
compact, as the organizations profiting from the community's labor do not
support the community's continued health and existence.

On a 3/4 vote from the Maintainers, known violators of this clause of the
Compact will be added to a FREELOADERS file in the software repository.
Organizations who believe they have been wrongly added to the FREELOADERS file
may request removal from the maintainers, and all requests will be granted.
Removal is not permanent.

## Network Services

[BUSINESS] may create network services around or in support of the software,
subject to various Terms of Service. [BUSINESS] may use these Terms of Service
to further monetize the [SOFTWARE].

If other parties wish to run network services around the [SOFTWARE], we ask
that they contribute to the community through the purchase of a network
services subscription from [BUSINESS].

## Consulting License

As the community grows, the desire for consulting businesses may also grow. The
community's desire is that, if you intend to make money on the [SOFTWARE] through
consulting and support, you contribute to the community through purchasing a
consulting license subscription from [BUSINESS].

We ask that all members of the community utilizing consulting businesses do so
from only those organizations committed to the community's growth and health.

## Contributor Exception

Contributors to the software or community may request an exception to the
FREELOADERS clause. It will be granted by by a 3/4 vote of the Maintainers.

Contributors to the software or community may request a reduced price ($1 USD, or
equivalent) Network Services Subscription or Consulting License from the
Maintainers. It will be granted by the [BUSINESS] on a 3/4 vote by the
Maintainers.
